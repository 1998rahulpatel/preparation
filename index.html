        Hello, my name is Rahul Kumar Patel. I have 4 years of experience in software development. I started my career at Cognizant, where I built a strong foundation in software development. Later, at eGain, I worked on scalable and cloud-based solutions. My skills include Java, Spring, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and AWS. I have experience in building web applications and optimizing cloud infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited about the opportunity to join Michelin, a company known for innovation and sustainability. I look forward to contributing my skills and growing with the team.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Did You Leave eGain?</h2>
      <p>
        I had a great experience at eGain, where I gained valuable knowledge and contributed to enhancing application performance. Since the development work is complete, I am now seeking a role that offers more challenging projects and aligns with my long-term career goals. Michelin’s commitment to innovation and sustainability excites me, and I believe this opportunity will provide the right platform for me to grow and make a meaningful impact.

      <p class="mb-4">
        I appreciate the opportunity to interview with Michelin and want to be fully transparent. I have offers in the pipeline and am an immediate joiner, but I’ve only shared this with Michelin because I genuinely want to be part of the company. I believe in honest negotiations, not counteroffers, which is why I’ve been upfront about my expectations. Based on my experience and market standards, I expect up to a 65% hike. My goal is to join Michelin with trust and contribute effectively.
